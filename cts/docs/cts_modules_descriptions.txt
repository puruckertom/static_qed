<p><b>Chemical Editor (CE):</b> Provides options for chemical entry by entering a SMILES string, IUPAC name, CAS#, or by drawing a structure for the chemical of interest.  Through the execution of the Calculate Chemical Speciation Workflow, the chemical speciation of a chemical, which includes the calculation of ionization constants, the dominant tautomer distribution, as well as structures for all possible isomers, can be calculated/generated. </p>

<p><b>Physicochemical Properties Calculator (PPC): </b> Calculates physicochemical properties for the parent chemical and predicted transformation products based on the executions of multiple physicochemical calculators.  The PPC is based on a consensus approach that would allow the user to compare output generated by a number of calculators that take different approaches to calculating specific physicochemical properties.  The calculators we are currently accessing include (1) SPARC (SPARC Performs Automated Reasoning in Chemistry), which uses a mechanistic-based approach, (2) EPI Suite, which uses a fragment-based approach, (3) TEST (Toxicity Estimation Software Tool), which uses QSAR-based approaches, and (4) ChemAxon plug-in calculators, which use an atom-based fragment approach.  The user also has the option to request measured data that is available in the EPI Suite physicochemical database.  </p>

<p><b>Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS)</b>: Generates potential transformation products based on user-specified reaction conditions. The output of the RPS is based on the selection and execution of reaction libraries that represent reaction schemes for the transformation of reactive functional groups (i.e., reduction and hydrolysis). These reaction schemes represent viable transformation pathways based on the identification and subsequent transformation of the reactive functional groups. A reaction library for human metabolism for phase 1 transformations developed by ChemAxon is also available through the RPS. The development of reaction libraries allow us to "encode" the known process science published (current and future) in the peer-reviewed literature. The encoding of process science is accomplished through the use of Chemical Terms Language and cheminformatics applications. The execution of these reaction libraries provides dominant transformation pathways and products for the chemical of interest as a function of environmental conditions. The user also has the option to execute the PPC for the calculation of physicochemical properties for the parent chemical and transformation products.</p>
